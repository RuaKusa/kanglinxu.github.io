Biographies
======
Kanglin Xu is an accomplished undergraduate researcher and computer science student at Texas Tech University, specializing in the application of machine learning in medical diagnostics. He is passionate about utilizing artificial intelligence to improve healthcare outcomes and has focused his research on the classification of ECG signals, blood cell types, and the development of computer-assisted diagnostic tools.

In his academic career, Kanglin has worked as a research assistant in the Wu Research Group at Texas Tech University, where he designed and developed neural networks for clinical diagnosis and analyzed large medical datasets. His work on ECG signal classification, where he transformed raw signals into image representations for deep learning models, has resulted in the development of reliable automated tools for early cardiac abnormality detection. Additionally, his blood cell classification project employed multi-level convolutional neural networks and transfer learning techniques to improve medical diagnostics.

Beyond healthcare, Kanglin has contributed to artificial intelligence research in multi-agent learning environments. His senior capstone project involved developing a card game using the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, demonstrating his proficiency in reinforcement learning and strategic decision-making systems.

Kanglin’s research output is extensive for an undergraduate, having co-authored several research articles and presented at the Undergraduate Research Conference in both 2023 and 2024. His work has also been highlighted in a presentation to the Computer Science Department External Advisory Board at Texas Tech University.

Kanglin’s academic excellence is reflected in his 4.0 GPA and multiple inclusions on the President’s List. He plans to pursue graduate studies, where he will continue advancing his research in machine learning, with a particular focus on deep learning applications in healthcare and multi-agent systems.
